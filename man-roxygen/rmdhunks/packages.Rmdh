# Using Pre-compiled models in your packages

If you have a package and would like to include pre-compiled RxODE
models in your package it is easy to create the package. You simple
make the package with the `rxPkg()` command.

```
library(RxODE);
## Now Create a model
idr <- RxODE({
    C2 = centr/V2;
    C3 = peri/V3;
    d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
    d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3;
    d/dt(peri)  =                    Q*C2 - Q*C3;
    d/dt(eff)  = Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
})

## You can specify as many models as you want to add

rxPkg(idr, package="myPackage"); ## Add the idr model to your package
```

This will:

- Add the model to your package; You can use the package data as `idr` once the package loads

- Add the right package requirements to the DESCRIPTION file.  You
  will want to update this to describe the package and modify authors,
  license etc.

- Create skeleton model documentation files you can add to for your
  package documentation.  In this case it would be the file
  `idr-doc.R` in your `R` directory
- Create a `configure` and `configure.win` script that removes and
  regenerates the `src` directory based on whatever version of `RxODE`
  this is compiled against. This should be modified if you plan to
  have your own compiled code, though this is not suggested.
  
- You can write your own R code in your package that interacts with
  the RxODE object so you can distribute shiny apps and similar things
  in the package context. 
  
Once this is present you can add more models to your package by
`rxUse()`.  Simply compile the RxODE model in your package then add
the model with `rxUse()`

```
rxUse(model)
```

Now both `model` and `idr` are in the model library. This will also
create `model-doc.R` in your R directory so you can document this
model.

You can then use `devtools` methods to install/test your model

```
devtools::load_all() # Load all the functions in the package
devtools::document() # Create package documentation
devtools::install() # Install package
devtools::check() # Check the package
devtools::build() # build the package so you can submit it to places like CRAN
```

# Using Models in a already present package

To illustrate, lets start with a
blank package

```
library(RxODE)
library(usethis)
pkgPath  <- file.path(rxTempDir(),"MyRxModel")
create_package(pkgPath);
use_gpl3_license("Matt")
use_package("RxODE", "LinkingTo")
use_package("RxODE", "Depends") ##  library(RxODE) on load; Can use imports instead.
use_roxygen_md()
##use_readme_md()
library(RxODE);
## Now Create a model
idr <- RxODE({
    C2 = centr/V2;
    C3 = peri/V3;
    d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
    d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3;
    d/dt(peri)  =                    Q*C2 - Q*C3;
    d/dt(eff)  = Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
});

rxUse(idr); ## Add the idr model to your package
rxUse(); # Update the compiled RxODE sources for all of your packages

```

The `rxUse()` will:
- Create `RxODE` sources and move them into the package's `src/`
  directory.  If there is only R source in the package, it will also
  finish off the directory with an `library-init.c` which registers
  all the RxODE models in the package for use in R.
- Create stub R documentation for each of the models your are
  including in your package. You will be able to see the R
  documentation when loading your package by the standard `?` interface.
  
You will still need to:
- Export at least one function.  If you do not have a function that
  you wish to export, you can add a re-export of `RxODE` using roxygen
  as follows:
  
```
##' @importFrom RxODE RxODE
##' @export
RxODE::RxODE
```

If you want to use `Suggests` instead of `Depends` in your package,
you way want to export all of RxODE's normal routines


```
##' @importFrom RxODE RxODE
##' @export
RxODE::RxODE

##' @importFrom RxODE et
##' @export
RxODE::et

##' @importFrom RxODE etRep
##' @export
RxODE::etRep

##' @importFrom RxODE etSeq
##' @export
RxODE::etSeq

##' @importFrom RxODE as.et
##' @export
RxODE::as.et

##' @importFrom RxODE eventTable
##' @export
RxODE::eventTable

##' @importFrom RxODE add.dosing
##' @export
RxODE::add.dosing

##' @importFrom RxODE add.sampling
##' @export
RxODE::add.sampling

##' @importFrom RxODE rxSolve
##' @export
RxODE::rxSolve

##' @importFrom RxODE rxControl
##' @export
RxODE::rxControl

##' @importFrom RxODE rxClean
##' @export
RxODE::rxClean

##' @importFrom RxODE rxUse
##' @export
RxODE::rxUse

##' @importFrom RxODE rxShiny
##' @export
RxODE::rxShiny

##' @importFrom RxODE genShinyApp.template
##' @export
RxODE::genShinyApp.template

##' @importFrom RxODE cvPost
##' @export
RxODE::cvPost

# This is actually from `magrittr` but allows less imports
##' @importFrom RxODE %>%
##' @export
RxODE::`%>%`
```

- You also need to instruct R to load the model library models
  included in the model's dll.  This is done by:

```
# In this case `rxModels` is the package name
##' @useDynLib rxModels, .registration=TRUE
```

If this is a R package with RxODE models and you do not intend to add
any other compiled sources (recommended), you can add the following configure scripts

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# This should be used for both configure and configure.win
echo "unlink('src', recursive=TRUE);RxODE::rxUse()" > build.R
${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript build.R
rm build.R
```

Depending on the `check` you may need a dummy autoconf script,

```sh
## dummy autoconf script
## It is saved to configure.ac
```

If you want to integrate with other sources in your `Rcpp` or
`C`/`Fortan` based packages, you need to include `rxModels-compiled.h` and:
- Add the define macro `compiledModelCall` to the list of registered
  `.Call` functions.
- Register C interface to allow model solving by
  `R_init0_rxModels_RxODE_models()` (again `rxModels` would be
  replaced by your package name).
  
Once this is complete, you can compile/document by the standard methods:

```
devtools::load_all()
devtools::document()
devtools::install()
```

If you load the package with a new version of RxODE, the models
will be recompiled when they are used.


However, if you want the models recompiled for the most recent version
of RxODE, you simply need to call `rxUse()` again in the project
directory followed by the standard methods for install/create a
package. 

```
devtools::load_all()
devtools::document()
devtools::install()
```

**Note** you do not have to include the `RxODE` code required to
generate the model to regenerate the RxODE c-code in the `src`
directory.  As with all RxODE objects, a `summary` will show one way to recreate the same model. 

An example of compiled models package can be found in the
[rxModels](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/rxModels) repository.
