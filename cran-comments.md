The following platforms were tested with a succesful check: MacOS release, Windows
  release, ubuntu devel, and ubuntu release.

Additionally solaris was tested on our local virtual machines as well
as on rhub with a successful check.

* Changed to depend on R 4.0 since Windows needs special instructions for using with old toolchain.
